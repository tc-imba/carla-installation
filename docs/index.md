# About

Many of the docs are copied or modified from the original [CARLA Documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/).

I added some notes and warnings based on my experience when building Unreal Engine and CARLA in various attempts.

Currently, only building on Windows is available. I may add Linux and macOS guide in the future.
